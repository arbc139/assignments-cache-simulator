# HW5: Cache simulation

# (1) single cache simulation
# 1) Cache configuration (LKN) to simulate: 64KB, 256KB, 512 KB
#     -N=1 case (fully associative mapping): LK=64KB, 256KB, 512KB (variables: L= 64, 128bytes)
#     -K=1 case (direct mapping): LN= 64, 256, 512KB (variable: L= 64bytes)
# -K=2, 4 case (set associative mapping, L= 64, 128bytes)
# 2) Use these attached traces as input for cache simulation
# 3) Collect cache misses and draw graphs and decide your best configuration of various L, K, N, on 256KB and 512 KB, in terms of miss ratio and AMAT.
# 4) Submit report and source list
# 5) Due: Apr. 26.

# Two address input trace files are attached as files. These files can be used as the input of your simulator. Address format is also attached.

# * This simulator will be used later to simulate more complex structures as your next HW.
